1. Build 
  -> mvn clean install -DskipTests
✔ Builds all microservices
✔ Runs through the parent POM
✔ Creates all JAR files in each module’s /target folder
✔ No need to run Maven in every service manually

2. Run all the jars / microservices
  -> chmod +x start-all.sh
./start-all.sh
starting all services
running all JARs one by one
automating the startup process
You don’t need to run every JAR manually.

2. stop all the jars/ microservices
Check running Java processes
ps aux | grep java

You will see output like:

govind    1234   java -jar eureka_server.jar
govind    1244   java -jar configservice.jar
govind    1250   java -jar api_gateway.jar

-> kill any specific id 
   kill 1234(give the id)

Each process has a PID (e.g., 1234, 1244, 1250).

2️⃣ Kill all Java processes

⚠️ This will stop ALL Java applications (including all microservices).

killall java
